Video Generator prompt guide—key tips and tricks
The correct way to prompt in our Video Generator differs quite a bit from what you may know from the AI Generator. You’ll need to think more like a director and less like a storyteller.

Skip the conversation 
Descriptions that use conversational prompting style, like “Can you show me a sunset?”, won’t work here. You need to cut straight to the point. Describe the scene instead: “golden sunset over a peaceful lake, soft glow in the sky, trees swaying gently in the breeze.”

Similarly, commands like “Make the water ripple” or “Add a cat to this scene” are a no-go. You’re not ordering the model around. Instead, describe what you want to see in a way that paints the picture: “calm lake with rippling water”.

Prompt: "woman tilts her head upward, gazing at balloons drifting into the sky, vivid, hyper-saturated colors, anamorphic lens flare, retro color grading, chromatic aberration, film grain and light leaks, rolling shutter effect"
Be detailed
Be as descriptive as possible, e.g., “sunset over a foggy lake, slow camera pan, reflections in the water, dramatic orange and purple sky.” The more visual details you provide, the closer the model will get to your vision.

But remember, you can’t create multiple scenes in one prompt. Each prompt generates one shot or one visual idea. Keep your prompt focused on a single moment. Want multiple scenes? You'll need to generate each one separately.

Prompt: "jeep speeding across desert, chased by a massive sandstorm, dynamic camera angle low to the ground, shadows, color-graded cinematic look [Tracking shot]"
Use technical terminology 
Want your video to look like it came straight out of a blockbuster? Use technical film terms in your prompts. These give the model specific instructions for lighting, camera effects, and more. 

Here's a collection of keywords that might come in handy:

Control camera movement in the Director mode
Video Generator's Director mode supports 15 specific camera movements. Click on your chosen movement below the prompt box to include it in your prompt.

The supported movements are:

Truck left/right: moves the camera horizontally to the left or right, keeping it parallel to the subject.

Pan left/right: rotates the camera horizontally on a fixed point.

Push in/Pull out: move the camera physically closer or farther from the subject.

Pedestal up/down: moves the camera vertically up or down, while maintaining its horizontal orientation.

Tilt up/down: rotates the camera vertically on a fixed point.

Zoom in/out: changes the focal length of the lens to make the subject appear closer or farther away.

Shake: add a shake effect to the camera.

Tracking shot: the camera follows a moving subject.

Static shot: the camera remains stationary.

Time to put your knowledge to the test! Start crafting your own prompts and transform static images into dynamic videos like never before.
